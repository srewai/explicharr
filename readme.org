* explicharr

sentence simplification with character-level [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762][transformer]]

** quick start

*** dependencies

- [[https://www.python.org/][python3]]
- [[https://www.tensorflow.org/][tensorflow]]
- [[https://www.nltk.org/][nltk]] (if you need the bleu scores)

*** to reproduce our results

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :eval no
cd src
#+END_SRC

- prepare the data

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :eval no
mkdir trial trial/data
./mock.py
./data.py
#+END_SRC

- train a new model

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :eval no
mkdir trial/model trial/pred
./train.py
#+END_SRC

by default, these paths are used.
- =src/trial/model= the model checkpoints
- =src/trial/pred= the predicted validation outputs
- =~/cache/tensorboard-logdir/explicharr= [[https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/summaries_and_tensorboard][tensorboard]] summaries for the validation loss and accuracy
